This is an experimental project while I'm learning Swift & SwiftUI. Please notice this project is not for production, as the database schema will be changed at any time.

Flash is a idea collecting app, you can quickly add your thought at any time.

It's like Twitter, so you can reply to your thought, quote your thought, all the quote and reply will be auto connected with the original thought.

You can also using tags to categorize your thought, Flash should be an inbox, I'm not intend to build it like a note app, there already thousand note apps.

The workflow will be:
1. when you got an idea, you add it to Flash;
2. when you got time, sitting down with your desktop device, then you can review your ideas;
3. you can drop it or add it to your own noting system.
